	<h1>Hello, there.</h1>
	<p>Hi! I'm Rebekah. I like to make things&mdash;often out of fabric, and sometimes out of code. Quilt Pattern Generator (QPG) is an attempt to combine the two: to use code to create random geometric quilt patterns out of squares and triangles. QPG provides yardage and pattern instructions for each quilt&mdash;if you find something you like, feel free to make it!</p>

	<p>QPG is inspired by the amazing work of <a href="http://www.libselliott.com/">Libs Elliot</a>, who creates and sells custom quilts and quilt patterns using <a href="https://processing.org/">Processing</a>.</p>

	<h1>Quilt and Block Size</h1>
	<p>QPG offers five quilt sizes and three finished block sizes, for a total of fifteen possible combinations.</p>

	<table>
		<tr>
			<th>Quilt Size</th>
			<th>2" blocks</th>
			<th>3" blocks</th>
			<th>4" blocks</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Lap: 36" x 36"</td>
			<td>18 x 18 blocks</td>
			<td>12 x 12 blocks</td>
			<td>6 x 6 blocks</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Twin: 66" x 96"</td>
			<td>33 x 48 blocks</td>
			<td>22 x 32 blocks</td>
			<td>11 x 16 blocks</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Double / Full: 84" x 96"</td>
			<td>42 x 48 blocks</td>
			<td>28 x 32 blocks</td>
			<td>14 x 16 blocks</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Queen: 90" x 96"</td>
			<td>45 x 48 blocks</td>
			<td>30 x 32 blocks</td>
			<td>15 x 16 blocks</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>King: 102" x 96"</td>
			<td>51 x 48 blocks</td>
			<td>34 x 32 blocks</td>
			<td>17 x 16 blocks</td>

	<p>Looking for something different? You can adjust the size of your quilt by adding sashing and borders or by removing rows or columns from the finished pattern.</p>

	<h1>Buying, Prepping, and Cutting Fabric</h1>
	<p>Each quilt pattern lists the necessary fabric yardage, rounded up to the nearest quarter of a yard. The yardage allows for some fabric shrinking and may, depending on the quilt, leave you with a bit extra for mistakes. Directions for prepping and cutting the fabric are included in each pattern, but the quick version is: wash and dry your fabric before cutting, then use a rotary cutter and a self-healing cutting mat to cut it.</p>
