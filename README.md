# Quilt Pattern Generator

Playing around with writing JavaScript that will generate a random quilt pattern that uses half square triangles and squares. 

Initially working with two colors; may eventually add multiple colors.

May also add additional kinds of quilt blocks/shapes.

## TODO
- color
	- make palette switcher buttons work
	- multiple color schemes
	- random color schemes
	- apply your own color scheme
- save (and share?) patterns
- generate random set of blocks, then repeat pattern as larger block
- handling a larger range of block sizes (perhaps user-entered?)
- include cutting and piecing instructions
- review variable scope
- clean up JS
- style
	- alert messages
	- form
	- yardage calculation
	- how to use this site
	- cutting and piecing instructions
- copy
	- FAQ
	- instructions for use
	- about
- maybe someday rewrite [this](http://www.levitated.net/daily/lev9block.html) in JavaScript, for fun

## COMPLETE
- 	color
	- polychrome (more than two fabrics)
	- random color for fabric A
- fix issue with proportionality of blocks
- switch to using canvas instead of a bunch of spans
	- draw quilt blocks on canvas
		- figure out how to create different block types
	- resize canvas & quilt diagram with window resize
- switch to standard quilt sizes + compatible block sizes
- way to change quilt size
- count (and display) # of HST and square blocks needed
- calcuate necessary yardage
  - figure out necessary math
- fix HST yardage calculation (divide yardage in the middle of the process, then round up)
- validate form entries
	- row needs to be a #
	- column needs to be a #
	- (for now) blocksize needs to be *something*
- apply warning styling to form fields when they fail validation
- add alert message to form fields when they validation
