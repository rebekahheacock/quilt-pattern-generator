# Quilt Pattern Generator

Playing around with writing JavaScript that will generate a random quilt pattern that uses half square triangles and squares. 

Initially working with two colors; may eventually add multiple colors.

May also add additional kinds of quilt blocks/shapes.

TODO
- save (and share?) patterns
- generate random set of blocks, then repeat pattern as larger block
- calcuate necessary yardage
- include cutting and piecing instructions
- style

COMPLETE
- way to change quilt size
- count (and display) # of HST and square blocks needed
